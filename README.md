## Timeline ##

## Week 4 ##
- [X] Set up MapView, autocomplete location search, detailed view of locations
- [X] Set up Back4App database
    - Create User, UserProfile, Location, and Review tables
        - Excluding OAuth to start
- [X] Set up Storyboard to navigate like the wireframe; only User Login, HomeScreen, User Profile, and Reviews implemented

**What This Will Look Like**
- [X] Able to log in with email + password
- [X] Able to post a review with a single picture (no multiple images yet...)
- [X] Able to read reviews

## Week 5 ##
- Allow filtering
- User profiles; allow editing
- [X] Create image slideshows; users can swipe between images that reviewers have left
- [X] Allow liking + disliking reviews. Top reviews come first.
- Begin heavier work with API; try to connect Places in detail with Google Maps more
    - Users can see GoogleMaps users' reviews
- Consider how to add reviews for sidewalks / crosswalks
    - This is an additional extra feature that I want to start thinking about, but is not part of the minimum viable product.
- Perhaps allow users to view another user's profile and give an "upvote". ie some users are considered "better" reviewers
        - Similar to StackOverflow?
        - Balance between providing more user privacy vs. greater sense of community

**What This Will Look Like**
- Able to use all of the functionality involving searching/filtering
- Able to customize profile information
- [X] Able to sort by best reviews
- Able to reverse search; get a POI (point of interest) from user's current coordinates
- User profile!

## Week 6 ##
- [X] Fix formatting + look. Create images for the launch screen, app icon etc.
- Provide customizable color palette / font sizes.
    - Will cache this locally
- Complete the minimum viable product
    - i.e. if there are things from Week 4 and 5 that weren't finished, finish them here.
- Try to reduce warnings + clean up code.

**What This Will Look Like**
- Everything on Wireframe will be complete!


## Week 7 ##
- Start with bonus / fun features!
- Try to incorporate the Measure app from iOS AR...
    - Start looking into this more! Not quite sure if it's possible yet.
- Try to incorporate autofill for user login; iOS saves login info in Apple Wallet?
- Perhaps email confirmation? For registering accounts
## Week 8 ##
- Polish features, write final self-evaluation
